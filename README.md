# Completed work for Horiseon Marketing Project
To Horiseon Marketing Team:
Thank you for giving me an opportunity on your project. Given the short deadline, I have focused on the key items you have asked for in order to improve the accessibility of your page. I trust that you will find my work to your liking. If there is anything else I can do for you, please let me know. 
Your webpage is hosted at https://anitapeppercorn.github.io/  for your review, and the source code is located in this repository https://github.com/anitapeppercorn/Horiseon-Marketing-Project1/
I have used the ‘Accessible Rich Internet Applications’  guidelines to improve accessibility: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label
Examples of items I have included to meet your acceptance criteria:
- Semantic HTML, uses a button for clickable items; <button aria-label="screen reader only label"></button>
- Added numerous comments to make the source code clear
- Included clear Href attributes 
- Added concise Title attributes
- Included a <nav> tag to defines a set of navigation links
- Added accessibility: Image attributes.
- Included an accessibility lang Attribute. The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag. Declaring a language is important for accessibility applications (screen readers) and search engines.
- Accessibility meta for viewport: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
I understand that as a marketing agency you desire a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that your own site is optimized for search engines. Towards this end I have focused on your Acceptance Criteria:
- Webpage meets accessibility standards
- Source code uses semantic HTML elements
- The structure of the HTML elements follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- The image elements have accessible alt attributes
- The heading attributes fall in sequential order
- The title elements are concise and descriptive.


Warm regards,
